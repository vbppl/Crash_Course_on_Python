    "> Programming languages are actually similar to humans spoken languages since they have a syntax and semantics.In a human language, **Syntax** is the rules for how a sentence is constructed while **Semantics** refers to the actual meaning of the statements. To form a sentence that others can understand, you need to know both the syntax that constructs the sentence and the semantics that gives it meaning.\n",

    "> A function is a piece of code that performs a unit of work. In the examples you've seen so far, you have only encountered the print() function, which outputs a message to the screen. You will use this function frequently in this course to check the results of your code. The syntax of the print() function is modeled in the example below.
