    "> **Annotating variables by type**\n",

    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Example:**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> name: str = “Betty”\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The variable name is declared using a colon (:) which is annotated with the type str, indicating that the name variable should hold a string value. And look, it does! Betty—or any name for that matter—is a string, and we know it’s a string because it is in quotes. Let’s look at another example where a variable holds an integer value.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> age: int = 34\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In this example, age is the variable, and int is the type annotation that provides you and other developers a hint that the age variable should store an integer value.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Pro tip:** If a function expects a list of integers, you should annotate it as List[int], not just List. Being specific with your types can catch more potential bugs and misunderstandings.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Dynamic typing**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Many languages, such as C# or Java, require you to declare variable types, but not Python. One of the great things about Python is that the type of variable can change over time as new values are assigned to it. For example: \n",
    ">\n",
    "> a = 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #a is an integer\n",
    ">\n",
    "> a = “Hello world” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #a is now a string\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Dynamic typing allows programmers to write code more quickly and offers flexibility because you don’t have to explicitly declare the type of variable.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note: Python decides which of the built-in types the variable is and, therefore, how it should behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Duck typing**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This form of typing comes from the saying, “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.” Python will infer the variable type at runtime and decide which behaviors are available to the given object.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">a = “Hello world” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #looks like a string\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Annotating variables with type comments**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Another way to annotate variables is to use type comments where the interpreter will ignore the comments.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> captain = “Picard”        # type: str\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note: This way of annotating variables might be useful for cases when you need to know what types belong to which variables but do not want the overhead of using a line interpreter (linter) or IDE on this specific variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Annotating variables directly**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Let’s use the same example above to annotate a variable directly.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> captain: str = “Picard”\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note: You might hear annotating variables directly called the more “modern” way to annotate a variable.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Another advantage is that you can use automated tools such as linters, or mypy, to check types to make code more resilient.\n",
    "\n",
    "> How type annotations affect runtime behavior\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Any time a library is called, or an IDE works to scan your code, more computational overhead is required.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Pro tip: Be strategic when annotating variables by type. This can add unnecessary overhead when overused.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Type annotation is less common with Python users in data science, as it can be burdensome to manually map data every time a new set of data comes in. On the other hand, when doing object-oriented programming or writing functions, using type annotations becomes extremely important because it helps clarify code since you are dealing with more than just the built-in types.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Key takeaways\n",
    "> Annotating variables by type provides programmers with benefits to make the code easier to read and understand. Python provides different options on how to annotate variables, so choose how you want to annotate them. Just be cautious of over-annotating, creating unnecessary overhead to your code."
