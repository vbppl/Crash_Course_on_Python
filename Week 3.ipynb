As you can see, range(4) (meaning index position 4) ends at the numeric value 3. In Python, this structure may be phrased as “the end-of-range value is excluded from the range.” In order to include the value 4 in  range(4), the syntax can be written as range(4+1) or range(5). Both of these ranges will produce the numeric values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. \n",

For example, if you have a loop with the range: for n in range(1, 5, 6), the range will only produce the numeric value 1. This is because the incremental value of 6 exceeded the ending point of the range.\n",
